\section*{Current Semester Objectives}

Throughout the next semester, we will design, build, and test a small-scale, air-breating, rotating detonation engine.

\begin{itemize}
    \itemsep0em
    \item Finalize design choices and modeling
    \item Perform FEA and hand calculations verifying safety parameters
    \item Finish procurement of materials
    \item Quote and machine components
    \item Perform assembly of component subsystems
    \item Perform final integration of subsystems into the full system
\end{itemize}

The data provided through the end of the project include a characterization of system thrust, combustion pressures, combustion temperatures, mass flow rates, and equivalence ratio validation. An operational map will be assessed to provide an overview of the systemâ€™s performance.
