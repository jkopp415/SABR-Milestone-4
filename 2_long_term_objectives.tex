\section*{Long Term Objectives and Payoff}

The long-term objectives of Project SABR are focused on advancing the development and understanding of air-breathing Rotating Detonation Engine (RDE) technology at small engine scales. By successfully demonstrating a stable detonation with atmospheric air and hydrogen, the project aims to establish a low-cost, scalable framework for future RDE research and applications. This technology can potentially revolutionize propulsion systems in hypersonic vehicles, guided munitions, and other aerospace systems by offering a compact, efficient alternative to traditional engines. The data and insights generated from this project will improve system performance, enable further miniaturization, and optimize operational efficiency. Additionally, the prototype and methodology developed will support ongoing research at the Propulsion \& Energy Research Laboratory (PERL) and serve as a reference for future RDE designs in academic and industrial settings.
