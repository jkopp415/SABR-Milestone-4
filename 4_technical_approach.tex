\section*{Technical Approach}

System performance is estimated by two group-generated software tools that predict the performance of the feed system and combustor by outputting critical dimensions and information about the working fluids. This information is translated into CAD via SolidWorks, where our design follows proper DFM practices to ensure the parts produced are cheap and easy to manufacture. Additional performance metrics such as material stress, thermal performance, and flow coefficients can be provided by simulation software such as Ansys mechanical and fluent to drive design choices but will require validation. After manufacturing the test stand, LabVIEW and Synnax will be utilized as the teamâ€™s supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system to collect data as tests are executed precisely.
